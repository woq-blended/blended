    // is connected to the correct broker. The default verifier always evaluates to true and allows the
    // connection.
    // To override this behavior, a connection verifier with a different "name"-property can be registered
    // in the container. The "verifier" setting below indicates, which verifier shall be used.
    // Likewise, a VerificationFailedHandler can be registered to determine the action that has to be taken
    // upon a failed verification. The DefaultVerificationFailedHandler is registered with the name "default"
    // and shuts down the container.

    // only happens once when the activator of the AMQ Client bundle is started.
