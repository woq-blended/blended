{scepclient} is a command line application that is capable to gather and renew certificates via a remote SCEP server. The certificates will be stores in a local Java keystore.

== Installation

Download and unpack the binary distribution file `{binpack}`.

Start the application with:

----
$ java -jar scep-client.jar
----

== Usage

The application operation is controlled via command line options:

----
$ java -jar scep-client.jar --help
Standalone SCEP client, which can create and update Java key stores
from a remote SCEP server.

Usage: java -jar scep-client.jar [options]

Options:
  --base-dir dir      Alternative base directory (aka scepclient.home,
                      used to lookup the etc directory)
  --expect-refresh    Expected a refreshed certificate. If no certificate was
                      refreshed the application will exit with exit code 5
  --help,-h           Show this help
  --password,-p seed  Generate a password from a given seed and salt.
                      The salt is either implicitly set or explicitly
                      given with --salt
  --refresh-certs,-r  Refresh or initial create a Java key store
                      containing certificates from SCEP server
  --salt,-s salt      Use this salt when generating a password with
                      --password
  --timeout sec       Timeout (in seconds) used when refreshing certificates
----

To initially get the configured certificate(s) use the following command:

----
$ java -jar scep-client.jar --refresh-certs
----

The same command is used to check and, if required, refresh the certificate(s).

After the certificates were initially fetched and checked successful, the application will return with exit code `0`.

In case of an error or if one of the certificates were no longer valid, the application will return with an exit code other than `0`.

If an error occurs while connection to the SCEP server or processing the certificates, _but_ all certificate are still valid, the application will return with exit code `0`.

Please note, that even though the scep-client is successfully communicating with the server and will get a certificate,
it must not necessarily get a _new_ certificate.
It is up to the server if you receive a newly generated certificate or an older one.
Just configuring a higher value for `minValidDays` does not guarantee a fresher certificate.
You can use the option `expect-refresh` to signal the case that no new certificate was received.
It will exit with an exit code other that `0` (currently `5`, but this may change in future).
This allows you to chain the scep-client with you server refresh logic only in case some certificate has changed:

----
scep-client --refresh --expect-refresh && do-some-server-refresh-logic.sh
----

You can inspect the application log file `log/scep-client.log` for processing and error details.

== Configuration

The binary distribution already contains a commented configuration file, which you can adapt to your need.
At least, you have to change the SCEP server URL as well as the desired certificates.

.Annotated example configuration `etc/application.conf`
----
// The blended SSL implementation uses a dynamically provisioned
// SSL Context. This SSLContext uses a certificate provider under
// the covers to obtain a server certificate when required.
// The server certificate is managed in the server's keystore for
// reuses and refreshed whenever it is about to expire.
blended.security {

    ssl {

      // This is the keystore file where the generated server
      // certificate is kept until it expires
      keyStore = ${scepclient.home}/etc/keystore

      // !!! NOTE : Once these passwords are changed, the keystore
      // !!! should be deleted to force a refresh of the server
      // !!! certificate

      // the storepass is used to generate the keystore password
      // this is not the effectively used password
      # storePass = "blended"

      // the keypass is used to generate the private key password
      // this is not the effectively used password
      # keyPass = "mysecret"

      explicit {
        // if defined, it replaces the blended.security.ssl.storePass with an explicitly
        // given password. The passwort will be used as-is.
        // Using the config encryption feature (storePass = "$[encrypted[h79ghg123]") is strongly encouraged.
        storePass = ""
        // if defined, it replaces the blended.security.ssl.keyPass with an explicitly
        // given password. The passwort will be used as-is.
        // Using the config encryption feature (keyPass = "$[encrypted[h79ghg123]") is strongly encouraged.
        keyPass = ""
      }

      // the configuration of the self signed certificate provider.
      // This is required as an initial SCEP request is performed
      // with a self signed certificate. The common name and
      // alternative names will be passed in from the certificate
      // configuration.
      selfsigned {
        validDays="10"
        keyStrength=2048
        signatureAlgorithm="SHA256withRSA"
      }

      // the configuration of the individual certificates. each
      // certificate configuration stands for a server certificate
      // that will be used within the server side ssl context.
      // Certificates are selected via SNI (requires Java 8 or greater).
      // The name of the config block will be used as the alias
      // with in the keystore.
      certificates {
        server1 {
          // The common name and alternative names for the certificate.
          commonName = "CN=server1, O=blended, C=DE"
          logicalHostnames = ["server1"]

          // The certificate provider used for provisioning certificates.
          // The provider 'default' will use self signed certificates;
          // the provider 'scep' we use a SCEP enabled server
          // to automatically provision server certifacates via SCEP.
          provider = "scep"

          // The amout of days before an certificate expiry the server
          // will try to refresh the certificate.
          // default: 10
          # minValidDays = 10
        }
      }
    }

    scep {
      scepUrl = "http://scep.server.url"

      // The profile, if required by the SCEP server (if unsure,
      // contact the SCEP administrator)
      // default : None
      # scepProfile =

      // The length of the key to sign requests sent to the SCEP server
      // default: 2048
      # keyLength = 2048

      // The signature algorithm to sign requests sent to the SCEP server
      // default: "SHA1withRSA"
      # csrSignAlgorithm = "SHA1withRSA"

      // The challenge password required by the SCEP server
      // default: None
      scepChallenge = "password"
    }
  }

=== Encryption of sensitive configuration data

To not expose sensitive configuration data like user credentials and passwords,
the configuration format supports encrypted notation of config values.

An encrypted value looks as follows:
----
key = "$[encrypted[8f359ca521]]"
----

To produce encrypted values, you can use the `BlendedEncryptor` tool.


== Export a server key and certificate to openssl

To use some server keys in other applications, e.g. openssl, you can convert the  keystore at `<scepclient-home>/etc/keystore` (which is in the proprietary JKS format) into the standardized format https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_12[PKCS#12].

The `keytool` is part of each Oracle Java distribution, and can be found under ``${JAVA_HOME}/bin/keytool`.

.Extract server key `<jkskeyalias>` into a PKCS#12 keystore
----
$ keytool -importkeystore \
-srckeystore <scepclient-home>/etc/keystore \
-destkeystore keystore.p12 -deststoretype PKCS12 \
-srcalias <jkskeyalias> \
-deststorepass <password> -destkeypass <password>
----

After than you can further process the `keystore.p12` with openssl.

.Export certificate from a PKCS#12 keystore
----
$ openssl pkcs12 -in keystore.p12  -nokeys -out cert.pem
----

.Export the private key from a PKCS#12 keystore
----
$ openssl pkcs12 -in keystore.p12  -nodes -nocerts -out key.pem
----

== Advanced use cases

=== Managing multiple keystores with one scep-client installation

Through the commandline option `--base-dir` you can tell the scep-client to use an alternative base directory.
It will then use the configuration `etc/application.conf` under that directory.
Also the keystore can be placed under that directory, when you use the `scepclient.home` variable, as in the above example.

.Configuration, to place the keystore relative to the directory given with `--base-dir`
```
blended.security.ssl.keyStore = ${scepclient.home}/etc/keystore
```
